# Client Load Balancer Exercise

## Files
- `endpoints.py`: exposes the interview surface. Use `EndpointServer` and call `print_summary()` when needed.
- `main.py`: scaffold with a minimal `EndpointClient` and a `__main__` entry point.

## Candidate Instructions
1. Use the existing `EndpointServer` instance.
2. Implement your calling strategy inside `main.py` (you may refactor the client).
3. Keep the script runnable with `python main.py`.
